{"body":"# Adobe Illustrator Scripts by Hiroyuki Sato  \r\n### Content Index\r\nThis repository includes a \"js\" and a \"jsx\" folder. They are the same scripts but with the \".js\" extension and Windows newline (CRLF). Maybe suitable for old CS on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe scripts are:\r\n```\r\n* [Adjust Dashes (offset)](## Adjust Dashes (offset))\r\n* Adjust Dashes\r\n* Arc Correction\r\n* Archimedean Spiral\r\n* Arrow-A, Arrow-V\r\n* Circle\r\n* Circumcircle\r\n* Common Tangents\r\n* Cut At Selected Anchors\r\n* Dance\r\n* Divide (length)\r\n* Dup At Selected Anchors\r\n* Extend Handles\r\n* Join Reasonably\r\n* Merge Overlapped Anchors\r\n* Metaball (Arc), Metaball\r\n* Path Length\r\n* Remove Anchors\r\n* Reverse\r\n* Round Any Corner\r\n* Sine Curve\r\n* Tangents From A Point\r\n* Tree-like\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General Note For Usage  \r\n\r\ntested with Adobe Illustrator CS5, Windows XP SP3 (Japanese version).  \r\ntested basic functions with CS6 tryout, Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Japanese version).  \r\n\r\n* How to Use the Scripts\r\nChoose File>Scripts>Browse, and open the script to run.  \r\nOr place the script in the directory \"Adobe Illustrator CS3\\Presets\\Scripts\", then restart Illustrator.  \r\n[Download the PDF documents for more information.](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.adobe.com+illustrator+CS3+javascript)\r\n \r\n* Selection of part of a path\r\nSome scripts work only for selected anchor points or sides (= lines, bezier curve segments). A side (= a line, a bezier curve segment) means one of each line segment drawn to connect a couple of anchor points. In other words, selected parts means targets for Cut or Copy command. Regular (or Group) Select Tool selects whole of a path.\r\n\r\n![Select the path](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_ways2select.gif)\r\n \r\n* A Compound Path Issue\r\nSome scripts don't work for some part of compound paths. When this occurs, please select part of the compound path or release the compound path and select them, then run script again. I still have not figured out how to get properties from grouped paths inside a compound path.\r\n\r\n* Illustrator 10 Issue\r\nAll the scripts was written to be compatible with AI 10 through CS3 (or later?). Only problem is AI 10 lacks a prompt dialog that users can specify the optional values. For now, one of the solution for this is to edit the scripts manually to change the default value of these varibles. They are most often placed in the beginning of the scripts with the appropriate comments.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Adjust Dashes (offset)\r\n![fig1](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_adjust_dashes_offset_en.gif)\r\n**fig.1** : This script adjusts dashed lines in the selection in order to the center of the first dash comes at each anchor points.  \r\nFor its purpose, when adjacent segments of an anchor of the target path have a difference in length -- a rectangle like above, for example --, this script splits the path at this anchor, applies a suitable dash setting for each splitted path, then put them into a group. This is a lockstep trick caused by an Illustrator path can have only one simple rule for dashes and gaps. This process also CLEARS FILL COLORS, if it needs, and if the pash has BUTT end cap, change it to PROJECTION end cap.\r\n\r\n**fig.2** : The left figure is splitted with pathfinder ( outline ), in order to make anchors at all intersection points.\r\n\r\n## Adjust Dashes\r\n![fig2](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_hasen_en.gif)\r\nAdjusts the lengths of dashes and gaps of dashed lines in order to the length of the path is divisible by total length of dashes and gaps.  \r\n\r\n## Arc Correction\r\n![fig3](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_arc_correction.gif)\r\ncorrects free-hand drawn arc-like paths in the selection. To use, just select the paths and run this script.  \r\nFor the (not need-to-know) detail of the method, please read the comments inside of the script with above figure.  \r\n\r\n## Archimedean Spiral\r\n![fig4](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_archimedes.gif)\r\ndraws an (approximated) Archimedean spiral.\r\n\r\n## Arrow-A, Arrow-V\r\n![fig5](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_arrow.gif)\r\ndraws arrow for each selected end (anchor) of the selected paths.  \r\n\"A\" and \"V\" mean the shape of the head of the arrow.  \r\nThe visible peaks of arrows exactly locate at each visible end of the selected paths.  \r\nThe end of paths are trimmed in order to avoid sticking out from the head of the arrow.  \r\nThe path with projection end cap is modified to but end cap.  \r\n\r\n## Circle\r\n![fig6](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_circle_en.gif)\r\ndraws a circle with specified number of anchor points.\r\n\r\n## Circumcircle\r\n![fig7](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_circumcircle.gif)\r\ndraws circumcircles for each selcted path\r\n\r\n**Method:**  \r\nThe major reason why I wrote this script is to draw a \"circumcircle\" for a star.  \r\nSo the method to find the center and the radius for the circumcircle is rather incertitude.  \r\n  \r\n1. find out a perpendicular bisector for the line connecting 1st and 2nd anchor  \r\n2. do the same for 1st and 3rd anchor (if the path is a triangle, 2nd and 3rd anchor)  \r\n3. find out intersection point of 1 and 2. for the center of the circumcircle to draw  \r\n4. find out the length of the line connecting the center and 1st anchor, then do the same for the center and 2nd anchor. define longer one as the radius of the circumcircle to draw.  \r\n  \r\n>The rightmost one in the figure above is a case of failure.  \r\n\r\n## Common Tangents\r\n![fig8](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_kyotsu_en.gif)\r\ndraws common tangents to the selected curved lines, if they are detected.  \r\n\r\n## Cut At Selected Anchors\r\ncuts selected paths at each selected anchor  \r\n\r\n## Dance\r\n![fig9](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_dance_en.gif)\r\nadds a new layer and draws dancing people on it\r\n\r\n*notice*\r\nThe dancers are made with various width of lines.  \r\nSo please remember to adjust the setting of Scale Tool for scaling strokes.\r\n\r\n## Divide (length)\r\n![fig10](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_divide_length.gif)\r\ndivides each selected segment into specified number based on the length.  \r\nThe length of each segment is equally distributed.  \r\n\r\n## Dup At Selected Anchors\r\n![fig11](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_dup_at.gif)\r\nduplicates the foreground object in the selection at the locations of the rest of each selected anchor points.  \r\n\r\n## Extend Handles\r\n![fig12](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_nobasu.gif)\r\nextends all handles of selected anchor points with specified rate.  \r\n100 : original size  \r\n120 : extend 20%  \r\n80 : shorten 20%  \r\n0 : remove handles  \r\n-100 : reverse handles  \r\n\r\n## Join Reasonably\r\njoins the open paths in the selection together with reasonable order  \r\n\r\n## Merge Overlapped Anchors\r\nmerges nearly overlapped anchor points.  \r\nalso reports how many anchor points had been reduced.  \r\n\r\nUSAGE: Select the path(es) and run this script.  \r\n\r\n## Metaball (Arc), Metaball\r\n![fig13](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_metaball.gif)\r\nThis script may help to create Metaball-like shapes  \r\n\"Metaball (Arc)\" uses arcs to connect. \"Metaball\" uses suitable bezier curves.  \r\n\r\nUSAGE : Draw some circles and select them, then run this script.  \r\nWhen a prompt appears, type in an optional value for the the connecting curves, then click OK.  \r\n(it doesn't check in the script whether each path is really a circle)  \r\n\r\n> Combining the shapes using Pathfinder may results several overlapping anchor points on the path. if it occurs, it may help to solve it to use my another script \"Merge Overlapped Anchors.js\". (See above)\r\n\r\n## Path Length\r\nfinds out length of the each selected path, and total length of the selected paths.  \r\nThen write out them on the artboard as text object.  \r\n  \r\n>This script uses JavaScript's \"length\" property of PathItem. if it is available (= CS3 or later). You can force calculate the length by \"use_native_property\" setting set to false. ( see inside the script )\r\n\r\n>NOTE:\r\n>The return values of \"PathItem.length\" property and the function in this script are slightly different especially in complex paths. It seems that the difference is 0.05 millimeter at most.\r\n\r\n## Remove Anchors\r\n![fig14](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_remove_anchors.gif)\r\nremoves selected anchor points\r\n\r\n## Reverse\r\nreverses the order of the anchor points of each selected paths  \r\n2009-05-23: comment-out showing alert part  \r\n\r\n## Round Any Corner\r\n![fig15](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_roundany.gif)\r\nrounds selected corners of PathItems.\r\nEspecially for the corners at the intersection point of curves,\r\nthis script may work better than \"Round Corners\" filter (but slower).\r\n\r\n**How To Use**\r\n\r\n* Illustrator CS\r\n1. Select the anchor(s) or whole path(es) to round.\r\n2. Run this script. A prompt box appears to set the rounding radius.\r\n    Input the radius in point, then click OK.\r\n> You can choose a behavior like Illustrator10 by change the setting.\r\n    (-- see \"setting\" section inside the script)\r\n\r\n* Illustrator 10\r\n1. Select the anchor(s) or whole path(es) to round\r\n    WITH a foreground path that specifies the rounding radius.\r\n    Half width of foreground path is used for the radius. (excluding stroke width)\r\n    Using a circle is most suitable for intuitive understanding and ease of use.\r\n    The script asks you to continue if there's a difference greater than 1 pt\r\n    between width and height of foreground path.\r\n2. Run this script. The foreground path is removed after rounding.\r\n> When the number of selected path is 1, predefined radius is used\r\n    for rounding. (-- see \"setting\" section inside the script)\r\n  \r\n![fig16](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/rac2.gif)  \r\n**Rounding Method**  \r\nBasically, the rounding method is compatible with the \"Round Corners\" filter. It is to add two anchors instead of the original anchor, at the points of specified line length from each selected corner. So if there're too many anchors on original path, this script can not round nicely.\r\n\r\n**Radius**  \r\nActually, the specified \"radius\" is not for a radius of arcs which drawn. It is for the line length from each selected corner and is for the base to compute the length of handles. The reason calling it \"radius\" is for compatibility with the \"Round Corners\" filter.  \r\n> This script does not round the corners which already rounded.\r\n> (for example, select a circle and run this script does nothing)\r\n\r\n> Note\r\n> In the rounding process, the script merges anchors which nearly overlapped (when the distance between anchors is less than 0.05 points).  \r\n> This script does not work for some part of compound paths. When this occurs, please select part of the compound path or release the compound path and select them, then run script again.  \r\n> I still have not figured out how to get properties from grouped paths inside a compound path.\r\n\r\n## Sine Curve\r\n![fig17](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_sine_curve.gif)\r\ndraws (approximate) sine curve at the origin of the artboard  \r\nThe values of the coordinates are based on [Don Lancaster's Guru's Lair Cubic Spline Library](http://www.tinaja.com/cubic01.asp).\r\n\r\n## Tangents From A Point\r\n![fig18](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_fromapoint.gif)  \r\n![fig19](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_fromapoint_tangency.gif)\r\ndraws tangent lines from a selected anchor point to selected curved segments.  \r\n  \r\nThis script tries to find a path with only 1 anchor selected, from foreground to background. And specifies the selected point of the path as starting point of tangents.  \r\n\"the selected curved segments\" means rest of the selected paths.  \r\n  \r\nYou can use an isolated point as the starting point. In this case, starting isolated point is removed after drawing tangents.  \r\n  \r\nDrawn tangents have handles at ends. So you can move the starting side of anchor point with keeping tangency.  \r\n\r\n## Tree-like\r\n![fig20](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/img/aics_script_tree_like.gif)\r\ndraws a tree-like shape at the center of the artboard \r\n> Note:\r\n> The trees are made with various width of lines. So please be careful about the setting of Scale Tool\r\nwhen you want to scale them.\r\n \r\n***\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe scripts are created by Hiroyuki Sato (@shspage), uploaded and maintained on GitHub by Shanfan Huang(@shanfan).\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nFree to use and distribute.\r\n![Creative Commons License](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png)\r\nAdobe Illustrator Scripts by [Hiroyuki Sato](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US).\r\n \r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFill out [the contact form on Hiroyuki's website](http://www.ne.jp/asahi/life/cycle/fd_en/fd.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
