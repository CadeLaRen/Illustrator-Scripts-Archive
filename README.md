# JavaScript Scripts for Adobe Illustrator

As far as I tested, they work fine from 10 ~ CS6  

The following scripts are created by Hiroyuki Satoï¼ˆ@shspage) . He is awesome.

As he indicated them as "Free to use and distribute", I thought it'd be great to open it up here. Although these were written a couple of years ago, I still found them very useful every now and then. Thank you Sato san.
