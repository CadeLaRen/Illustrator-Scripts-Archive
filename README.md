# JavaScript Scripts for Adobe Illustrator 10 - CS5

As far as I tested, they work fine in CS6  

The following scripts are created by Hiroyuki Sato  
pub.hiro.s@to.email.ne.jp  
Or on GitHub @hiroyuki-sato

As he indicated them as "Free to use and distribute", I thought it'd be great to open it up here. Although these were written a couple of years ago, I still found it useful every now and then. Thank you Sato san.  

For more information about how to use these script, check out [the instruction](http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html).
